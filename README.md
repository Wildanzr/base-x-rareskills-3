A Foundry-based template for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults. Forked from
[PaulRBerg/foundry-template](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/foundry-template).

## Base x RareSkills

This is a learning bootcamp from Base in collaboration with RareSkills. Learning about Blacklists, blacklist bypasses,
pausable tokens, fee-on-transfer-tokens, re-entrancy, WETH, tokens with an unusual number of decimals, SafeTransferFrom,
SafeApprove, and corner cases with zero transfers or the zero address, ERC-721, ERC-1155, wrapped NFTs.

### Homework 3

Creating an implementation of ERC721 with the following requirements:

- Minting price of $2 USDC
- Atomicswap with ERC20
