A Foundry-based template for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults. Forked from
[PaulRBerg/foundry-template](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/foundry-template).

## Base x RareSkills

This is a learning bootcamp from Base in collaboration with RareSkills. Learning about Blacklists, blacklist bypasses,
pausable tokens, fee-on-transfer-tokens, re-entrancy, WETH, tokens with an unusual number of decimals, SafeTransferFrom,
SafeApprove, and corner cases with zero transfers or the zero address, ERC-721, ERC-1155, wrapped NFTs.

### Homework 3

Creating an implementation of ERC20 token but not using any standard library like OpenZeppelin. The goal is to learn how
to implement the ERC20 token from scratch (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION). Also creating a simple contract to deposit
ERC20 with proper safe transfer from OpenZeppelin library.
